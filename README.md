# odin_recipes

This project utilizes The Odin Project's course materials and guidance in
order to practice HTML skills. Such skills include boilerplate creation,
anchors/links, images, and text - strong, bold, emphasized, italics.

Additional skills include familiarity with the Git workflow and VSCode.


Personal Reflection:
This project was fun to do for Thanksgiving, and it definitely
helped me get used to the Git workflow. Can't wait for the next
one!
